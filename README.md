# GUI-Hash-Checker

3/2017

Compare MD5, SHA1, SHA256 of file to file or file to hash.



Made this a while back, it was my first attempt at a GUI python script.  Not sure what limitations it has. I seem to remember that it can't handle or is real slow handling large files.  Thought someone might get some use from it, perhaps as a simple example of tkinter python script.
